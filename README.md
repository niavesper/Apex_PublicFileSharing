This code changes the default sharing setting for files uploaded torecords of a custom object Award__c from private to public. The requirement was to make files uploaded by internal users visible to authenticated Experience Cloud users by default.

ABOUT THE TEST CLASS:

We are testing only the scenario where we update ContentVersion records, not insert them. It's my understanding that testing insertion is not possible because during insertion of a ContentVerison, ContentDocumentLink is created automatically, and there is no way to relate it to the Award__c record via Apex. When you add a file in the UI, you do it from the record's page, in the Files related list. This lets the system "know" which record's ID to put in the LinkedEntityId on the ContentDocumentLink. There's no way to simulate this behavior via Apex, when the trigger is on ContentDocument, as far as I can tell. So by default, ContentDocumentLink gets related to the running user, and there is no way to make it related to Award__c records via Apex. All this prevents us from being able to test the change to file sharing settings upon ContentVersion creation.
